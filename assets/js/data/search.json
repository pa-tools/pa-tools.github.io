Some research groups or private citizens want to keep their devices private for a number of reasons, but it can still be handy to see these devices on a map. Using the API, along with some simple HTML and JavaScript, you can easily visualize a group of devices much like the Purple Air website.Getting Started You’ll first need an API key, you have to contact Purple Air to receive a key Then you’ll need a group with devices (belonging to your account). This can be done programmatically or via the API page. Once you have both, you can plug in the values to our hosted web page: https://pa-tools.github.io/pa-group-map/CustomizingTo customize the look and feel of the web page, you can clone our repository and edit index.html. If you’re going to do this, please use your own Mapbox Token by creating an account here and update the value in the page’s &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; section.Tools Used: Mapbox Bootstrap JavaScript Fetch API" } ]
