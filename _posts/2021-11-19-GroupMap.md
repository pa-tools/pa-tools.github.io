# Purple Air Group Map

Using Purple Air devices for research is becoming more and more common thanks to their low cost and high quality of tooling (website, API, community). Some research groups or private citizens want to keep their devices private for a number of reasons, but it can still be handy to see these devices on a map. Using the [API](https://api.purpleair.com/), along with some simple HTML and JavaScript, you can easily visualize a group of devices much like the Purple Air website.

## Getting Started

1. You'll first need an API key, you have to contact Purple Air to receive a key
1. Then you'll need a group with devices (belonging to your account). This can be done programmatically or via the [API page](https://api.purpleair.com/#api-groups-create-group).
1. Once you have both, you can plug in the values to our hosted web page: https://pa-tools.github.io/pa-group-map/

## Customizing

To customize the look and feel of the web page, you can clone our [repository](https://github.com/pa-tools/pa-group-map) and edit `index.html`. If you're going to do this, please use your own Mapbox Token by creating an account [here](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) and update the value in the page's `<script>` section.

**Tools Used:**

- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [JavaScript Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
